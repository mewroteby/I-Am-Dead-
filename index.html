  <h1>I Am Dead</h1>

  <p><strong>Let’s take a look at what happens if I am gone.</strong></p>

  <h2>My Parents</h2>
  <p>My parents are shattered, crying their hearts out, begging God to take their lives instead and spare me. My mother clutches my lifeless body, shaking me desperately, pleading with me to wake up, to call her 'Mom' just one last time. Her eyes, swollen and red, search for any sign of life in me, but I remain still. She strokes my hair like she always did when I was a child, whispering prayers between her sobs.</p>
  <p>My father, the strong man who held our family together, stands frozen, his broad shoulders trembling. Tears silently roll down his face as he struggles to comprehend the unbearable reality. He tries to be strong, tries to control himself, but he breaks—because of me. He whispers, <em>"Why? Why so soon? My child... my son... please, just come back..."</em> But I don’t. And he is not ready to believe it.</p>

  <h2>My Sisters</h2>
  <p>I have two elder sisters, and they are both beside me, their hands trembling as they touch my cold skin. <em>"Why aren’t you teasing us anymore? Where is our little brother who used to irritate us? Why are you so quiet now?"</em> They call my name again and again, refusing to accept that I will never answer.</p>
  <p>Between sobs, they try to console our mother, but they themselves are broken beyond repair. They reminisce about all the times I annoyed them, the endless playful arguments, the secrets we shared, the love that was left unspoken. And now, they sit there, helpless, whispering how much they love me, how much they wish they had said it more often.</p>

  <h2>My Grandmother</h2>
  <p>My grandmother, the woman who spent her life protecting me, is now sitting near my body, her frail hands trembling. She weeps bitterly, her voice barely above a whisper as she begs God to take her instead. <em>"He saw nothing in his life, God... He was just a child... Why did You do this? Take me... let him live..."</em></p>
  <p>But no one answers. Only silence remains. She strokes my face, her fingers cold, her heart shattered. She recalls the bedtime stories she told me, the sweets she secretly gave me, the prayers she whispered for my happiness. But now, she has nothing left to pray for.</p>

  <h2>My Neighbors</h2>
  <p>Some of my neighbors rush to inform my relatives, their voices heavy with sorrow, while others gather the necessary things for my funeral. Women enter my house, embracing my mother, my sisters, my grandmother, trying to comfort them. Some weep with my family, their tears genuine, their pain real. Others quietly observe, waiting for the rituals to be done so they can return to their daily lives.</p>
  <p>A few are just waiting for the funeral to end, sipping tea, talking about how unpredictable life is. <em>"So young,"</em> they say. <em>"So unfortunate."</em> But tomorrow, they will move on.</p>

  <h2>My Friends</h2>
  <p>Some of my closest friends are crying, struggling to process what just happened. Some are lost in silence, their eyes filled with regret. A few are too shaken to even come to my funeral. Some whisper prayers, asking God to bring me back, knowing deep down that it's impossible.</p>
  <p>And there is at least one friend—one who couldn't make time for me when I was alive, who ignored my calls, who left messages unread—who now wishes they had done things differently. They will regret it for the rest of their life. They scroll through our old chats, their fingers trembling, staring at my last message, my last joke, my last words, wishing they had responded, wishing they had one more chance.</p>

  <h2>The World Outside My Home</h2>
  <p>The air outside my house is heavy with sorrow. Some people are making funeral arrangements, following the customs of our religion. Others are gossiping, standing in groups, watching from a distance. A few are already calculating how much longer they need to wait before they can return to their daily routine. The street in front of my house is filled with murmurs, whispers of disbelief, hushed condolences, and empty words that mean nothing to my grieving family.</p>

  <h2>The Next Day</h2>
  <p>Some of my relatives sleep peacefully. Some do not. My family, though exhausted, has not stopped crying. My mother’s eyes are swollen shut, her body too weak to even sit up. My father has aged overnight, his silence louder than any scream. Some neighbors bring food and tea, though no one has the appetite to eat. Slowly, some relatives begin to leave, going back to their normal lives. Some stay for a few more days, still talking about me, still grieving.</p>

  <h2>My Social Media</h2>
  <p>My social media accounts remain as I left them—frozen in time. My last messages will remain unanswered. My YouTube channel will become lifeless, just like me. The things I once used—my phone, my laptop, my clothes, my books—will now belong to my family. They will hesitate to touch them at first, but eventually, they will move them away, unable to bear the pain of seeing them every day. My unread messages will pile up, my notifications will stop, my online presence will fade, just like my existence.</p>

  <h2>The Funeral - A Final Goodbye</h2>
  <div class="hindi">
    था मैं नींद में और मुझे इतना सजाया जा रहा था। <br>
    बड़े प्यार से मुझे नहलाया जा रहा था। <br>
    ना जाने कौन सा खेल मेरे घर में, बच्चें की तरह मुझे कांधे पर उठाया जा रहा था। <br>
    था पास मेरा, हर अपना उस वक्त, फिर भी मैं हर किसी के मन से भुलाया जा रहा था। <br>
    जो कभी देखते भी नहीं थे मुझे प्यार की निगाहों से, <br>
    उनके दिल से भी मुझ पर प्यार लुटाया जा रहा था। <br>
    पता नहीं क्यों हर कोई हैरान था, मुझे सच्चे देखकर, <br>
    जादू करके मुझे जगाया जा रहा था। <br>
    बहुत प्यार था, जिनके दिलों में मेरे लिए, <br>
    उन्हीं के हाथों से आज मैं जलाया जा रहा था। <br>
    इस दुनिया में कोई अपना नहीं होता दोस्त, <br>
    शमशान में अपने ही पूछते हैं और कितना टाइम लगेगा।
  </div>

  <h2>As Time Passes</h2>
  <p>A week later, my family is still crying, though less frequently. My friends miss me, reminiscing about our moments together. My relatives, now back to their homes, talk about me only when my name is mentioned. My neighbors continue to bring food for thirteen days, offering their silent support.</p>
  <p>A month passes. Life starts moving again. People return to their routines. But for my family, nothing is the same. They wake up expecting to see me, only to be reminded that I am no longer there. My mother still sets a plate for me at dinner, only to realize halfway through that I will never sit there again.</p>
  <p>A year later, my name is brought up in conversations, sometimes with laughter, sometimes with tears. <em>"Remember when he used to do this?"</em> someone will say, and for a brief moment, I will live again in their memories. But the world does not stop for the dead. Everything continues, as if I was never there—except for those who truly loved me.</p>

  <h2>What I Feel Watching All This</h2>
  <p>I look at my family, my friends, my home, and I feel sadness—not because I am gone, but because they are suffering. I wish I could tell them not to cry, that I am okay, that I will always be with them. I regret nothing, but if I ever hurt anyone, I hope they forgive me.</p>
  <p>If I could live a thousand lives, I would choose the same one, with the same people, the same moments. Because no matter how short my time was, I was blessed to have been surrounded by love. And if there is one thing I pray for, it is that everyone cherishes their life, loves deeply, helps without expecting anything in return, and finds happiness in every moment.</p>
  <p><strong>Because life is fragile. And when it’s gone, it’s gone.</strong></p>
